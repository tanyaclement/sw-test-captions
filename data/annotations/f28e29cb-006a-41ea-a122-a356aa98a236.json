I met Kazik Ratheiser, Frania Beatus, I think I also met Lodzia Hammerstein, the one who is now in Washington, in the Library of Congress, we are close friends. The other people I met later in the Old Town (Warsaw quarter). It was on August 7 or 8 (1944). Someone called my name and I saw Sara standing in a group of people, some of them looking Jewish. She  told me they wanted to join Armia Ludowa (People's Army). First they had tried to join AK (Armia Krajowa, Home Army), as a unit, but AK did not want them. I had also been looking for a contact with AL (Armia Ludowa) for a few days. I had tried AK but I did not have any recommendations and at that time they had many more volunteers than they could accept so I had been unsuccessful.\n\nShe told me that at that moment Antek was talking in the AL headquarters and a few minutes later he got out and said they were to be in third battalion, captain Hiszpan's unit"

          "text": "I told them that I was in the fourth battalion \"Czwartacy\". I met people about whom I had heard a lot before: Antek, Cywia, Marek, Tuwia Borzykowski. There was Kazik, Stefan Grajek, Zygmunt and Marysia Warman. I do not remember everybody. We lived close because I was at 16, Freta street and they spent nights in the basements of the marketplace in Swietojerska street. It was a five minute walk so I would visit them. Our hospital was there and they lived next to it. I remember discussions with Cywia when for the first time I had detailed information about Zionism and Palestine. At that time I knew a little about various Jewish parties but I thought that the best way for Jews was assimilation, a long process. I thought assimilation, like in Western Europe, was necessary because Jewish religion caused backwardness and a hiatus between the Polish and Jewish societies and that it should be like in Western Europe where Jews preserved their religions but there was no alienation from the society like in Poland. On the other hand I somehow considered BUND all right but I did not think it was good for Jews to strive to be so separate. As regards Zionism I was far from it. I had never been against it but I thought it was a collection of very beautiful ideas but totally unrealistic. First, because it (Palestine) was an Arab territory, second, because it was a strategically important area for many imperialist countries. Moreover, it was a very poor country, who would finance the venture, etc. I knew there were groups of people who went (to Palestine), I knew a little about halutzim who had been preparing to go there. Zivia gave lectures to me about halutzim, about draining the swamps in Emek Israel. She talked about a kibbutz and the history of Zionism, I do not remember the details. Later, when I described the discussion in my book, Mrs. Wichow, the editor working in the Wydawnictwo Ministerstwa Obrony Narodowej (Publishing House of the Ministry of the National Defense) told me I had to change the description because it looked as if Zivia had persuaded me that she was right. I told her that Zivia had managed to change my opinions. Fortunately, the editor changed her job later and so I preserved the discussion in my book. These discussions with Zivia took place during Warsaw Uprising when everything was happening around us. \n"

          "text": "Sara disappeared again. It turned out that she, Kazik and a few others had gone to Leszno (street) to get their guns, archives and money and then they could not return, only Marek returned. I had no information about Sara.\n\nDuring the night of 27 and 28 (September, 1944) ZOB was to be transferred to Zoliborz. AL was there, the third and the fourth battalion included. By chance, I did not enter the canals with my battalion but only later, with the last partisans, and although all the others, about 300 people, had made it we were not able to go through the canals because the water was up to our chins at that time. A few people had drowned-- the shorter or weaker ones-- and we had to return. So I lost touch with everybody. Later when I was staying in Krakow hospital, after my arm had been amputated, I got a letter from one of my aunts saying that she had seen Sara in Krakow, Sara had just returned from forced labor in Germany and she was planning to visit me in Krakow. I saw Sara several times. The most memorable for me was the evening when I stayed for the night in kibbutz in Poznanska stree, a few  apartments formed this kibbutz. We were invited for dinner. I had not visited Sara very often because it was far to walk there from Bielany (Warsaw  quarter) where I lived and, before my father returned, we did not have much to live on so there was no money to get a cab. So I remember we all were sitting at the table but Antek was not with us and then he came, stood in the doorway and did not say anything for a while. Everybody stopped talking and then he said, in low voice but since there was silence we could hear his words very distinctly: \"Today Germans have signed the act of capitulation\". I remember that we all said in unison \"too late\".\n\nSara visited me in Bielany, I have also visited her several times. She told me that she wanted to go to Palestine because first, Poland was like a cemetery and she did not have any relatives here any more and second, she wanted to be with her friends. I answered that she did not like being hot and that the conditions of life in Palestine were very harsh. Later she lived in kibbutz in Lodz and I visited her there. We went to Ida Kaminska's (Jewish) theatre. She was to visit me in Warsaw but she did not and again she \"disappeared\". "

Sara described her life in kibbutz and we kept in touch since then (she wrote warm letters but rather rarely).\n\nAt the beginning of '60-ties Bartoszewski went to Israel for the first time, it was before the Six Day War. I asked him to visit Sara and later he was very glad that he had seen Kibbutz Lohamei Haghettocot (Sara had been one of the founders of Kibbutz Lohamei Haghettocot along with the whole group, i.e. Antek, ziviz, Kazik, etc.) "

          "text": "Sara's life was very sad. She did not marry, did not have children. She dreamt about studying. She was not particularly good at manual labor. Neither she succeeded in her private life nor her professional life. About ten years later she became schizophrenic and she hated Antek, Zivia and her other friends as well as the kibbutz and kibbutz rented an efficiency for her in Tel Aviv and  found her a job in the institute of protected work. Every year I used to get a few short postcards from her. She wrote that she did not like her life, she did not earn much, life was hard for her and she did not describe her former friends in kind words. It was really a tragic story. Before she got ill she had called me once. For kibbutz it was a very expensive phone call. When Zivia learnt about it she was shocked. I have never seen Sara again-- have seen Zivia. It has been ten years since Sara died. I have a photograph of her grave.\n\nI was in Israel in 1985 and 1988. Antek and Zivia had already died. I knew a lot because I met Anolik when he first visited Poland and I kept in touch with a lot of people in Israel but I did not write there directly. After 1967 all contacts with Israel were strongly discouraged unless one had a very close family there, so either when I went abroad I sent letters to Israel or I asked my friends who went to Western Europe to send my letters and usually friends from Israel would quickly send an answer there and my friends would bring me the letters or some news which had been communicated to them orally. Of course it was not possible to explain everything to Sara, she would not understand why she was supposed to write to Switzerland or some other country so Sara was the only person whom I wrote short postcards and I got short messages from her.\n\nAt that time UB (Urzad Bezpieczenstwa, Security Police) harassed me, not because of my postcards to Sara, but because of my contacts with the (Israeli) Embassy. Through Kazik I had very nice contacts with Mr. Necer and his family, I visited them several times, they had also paid me some visits. Among others, they and their children visited me at Christmas time and of course UB knew about it and asked a lot of questions. Under their pressure I agreed that I did not have to have contacts with the Israeli Embassy but I told them I did have to meet my old friends whenever they came from Israel. Of course, later contacts with Israel did not have to be kept secret. "

Anyway, it was Kazik who officially introduced me and he gave the official speech when I went there.\n\nDue to my contacts with ZOB during WWII I got interested in Zionism and Israel. Later I wrote several essays and a book on these subjects. Five of these essays have been published and I have a one hundred page essay which has not been published yet. I am one of the founders of the Society of Polish and Israeli Friendship. My friends also call me a \"kibbutz expert\". Your friend helped me to get statistics when I was writing this one hundred page paper on Israel and kibbutz.\n\nI am not an architect, it was impossible after I lost my hand. I graduated from the Higher School of Commerce and I taught at this school for twenty years. In 1968 I lost this job because I slapped a UB woman (security policewoman) in the face during discussion. She had distorted my meanings several times and she had said a lot of untrue statements about students (in 1968 there were student demonstrations in Poland). A lot of people lost their jobs at that time but only I was fired immediately and without getting paid.  Moreover, I was on trial for hooliganism, I could have been sentenced to one year in prison. There were two trials, one in May and the other in October and finally I was cleared. At that time I had to support my son who was just graduating from his college. Before I got my job back after nearly five years I had had to earn my living doing only commissioned jobs.\n\nAt the higher school I taught social politics, especially rehabilitation of the disabled people and social gerontology. For the last few years I have been writing a lot about Israel since this subject is of great interest to me."
