As a young and socially sensitive priest he was active in helping workers, later in the 1930s he became engaged politically and was known for his antisemitic rhetoric. Because of his age at the beginning of the war he wanted to retire. However, he decided not to abandon the parish when the order establishing the ghetto was issued. He opened a kitchen for the poor and issued false baptismal certificates that helped many Jews go into hiding. With the help of nuns he transported Jewish children out the ghetto to an orphanage in the Warsaw suburbs. Posthumously he was honored with the medal of Righteous Among the Nations."

The farm became a base for the ŻOB fighters. It existed until December 1942, when the ŻOB members returned to the ghetto in order to prepare an uprising. The Jewish uprising ended on 19 April 1943, when SS troops commanded by gen. SS Juergen Stroop entered the ghetto."
