I was surprised because it was a few months after the liquidation of nearly all of the ghetto and Jews lived there, the fence was low, everybody could jump over it and on top of that the gate was open.\n\nSomeone was passing and I asked him to call Sara. We talked for a short time because it was late, there was a curfew in Warsaw and my way back home would take me at least an hour and a half.\n\nI asked how she managed to survive the liquidation of the ghetto. I had worried about her very much. We were able to help most of our friends. Olga Zweibaum, when she was on the \"Aryan\" side, called my brother and told him about the terrible round-ups in the ghetto and using our secret code name for courts (in Leszno street) told him that this way of escape was still open. We phoned our friends and most of them managed to escape within the next three days. It was impossible to tell Sara about it because she did not have a telephone and she lived too far from all of my friends to ask anyone to go to her place because of the round-ups. I was afraid she had died because she was never practical in life, did not have much life experience. When I got the postcard from her I was very happy. She told me that it was due to a lot of lucky coincidences that she had survived. Her whole family had been sent to gas chambers. "

She managed to escape several times, a few times while she was being marched to Umschlagplatz, once she kicked a German policeman who was dragging her and he fell down the stairs. Anyway she had survived and with the other members of the organization she joined halutzim from the Grochow farm who had been working in Czerniakow estate since the beginning of WW II. I do not know how many of them worked there, a few scores or maybe one hundred people. She told me that the conditions were very harsh. They dug out and ate raw vegetables from the fields in November, they washed themselves in cold water in a pond. Inside their barracks there were only primitive bunks and a few oil lamps. However, they were in a good mood, although they were unsure of their future. I asked them whether they did not want to escape. They told me that, theoretically speaking, they were guarded by an old volksdeutsche but he was a very decent man and he helped them a lot, for instance the postcard I had got had been sent by him. A lot of them tried escaping but they did not have addresses to go to in Warsaw and they did not know where there were partisans. Besides, they thought that most of them had bad accent or bad \"looks\" (pronounced semitic features). Most of those who had tried escaping were caught. She, herself, [Sara] had already been at the station but had returned because she was afraid of trying to escape. Only then, at the gate and while talking to her, did I realize the degree of isolation of Jews in the Polish society. It was not the walls but the fact that they did not have addresses and even if they had had the addresses they would not have been able to get there without help. There was an enormous difference between them and the assimilated Jews. Assimilated Jews, our friends, often lived in our apartment staying for a night or for a few weeks or months. Only in Czerniakow did I realize how isolated these two societies were although they had been living together, side by side, for one thousand years. I told her I was unable to take her to my apartment at the moment because someone from the ghetto, Hanka Szapiro-Sawicka, had already been staying in it. Every few days Hanka would come and stay for the night. However, I told her to come immediately to me if she was in danger. Later I was very ashamed that I told her that because I should have known better that it is impossible to escape in the last minute and one should escape much earlier. "

I asked the same woman in the nearby house for information about them but she only told me that they had been marched somewhere a few days before. Later someone told me that they had been marched to a small camp in which the conditions were terrible, i.e. they were treated in the same way as Russian prisoners of war: they were to live in winter without barracks and they were dying of cold. I knew about the conditions in the camps for captured Russian  soldiers because my father who had a good camera used to go to the numerous apartments in which 150 Russian escapees hid and he took pictures which were necessary to procure Polish documents for them. Later these Russian soldiers joined AL (Armia Ludowa, People's Army) partisans. I also took pictures and twice I had a very difficult task because I had to take pictures of two Mongols in such a way that the pictures did not show they were Mongols but, on the other hand, the pictures had to resemble them.\n\nSo I got the information that Sara and other people were in such a camp and they all died of hunger. Fortunately, it turned out it was not true.\n\nDifferent people visited or lived in our apartment. Hanka Szapiro-Sawicka often slept in our apartment and every Wednesday her father, who had assumed the name of Boleslaw Sadowski, visited her in our apartment. They loved each other very much and tried to spent a lot of time together. In August 1942, when Mr. Szapiro came to us he had a high temperature. He stayed in our place and it turned out that it was typhus. Hanka stayed a lot of hours by his bed. Kazio Zweibaum-- presently prof. Zakrzewski-- who had already been a doctor was with him a lot time too. Later we had to bury Bernard Szapiro. Then Hanka Szapiro-Sawicka was arrested. After her death a lot of informers came to our apartment pretending they were conspirators)so my parents decided to send me out of Warsaw  and I stayed at my friend's near Deblin for a few weeks. "

          "text": "At the beginning I belonged to ZWM and all people who belonged to ZWM were counted as members of AL but I did not take part in fighting until Warsaw Uprising (in 1944) and I was only responsible for education.\n\nIn early spring in 1943 when I worked in Zoloborz (Warsaw quarter) an unknown young man came to my apartment, he did not give his name to my mother, he only said he wanted to talk to me. Next time he brought a letter from Sara who asked me to procure documents for her no matter what the cost might be. I did not quite understand it but, anyway, I could not do anything without a photograph. Then Frania Razmus, a ZOB (Zydowska Organizacja Bojowa, Jewish Fighting Organization) liaison officer, came to my apartment. She looked like a peasant fourteen year old girl, in fact she was sixteen. She did not have a trace of bad accent or \"look\". She was very courageous. She was to bring the photographs and money for the documents and Sara was to come to our apartment before Easter (1943). As I have already mentioned I had to leave Warsaw for a few weeks. When I was at my friend's I got news about the outbreak of the Ghetto Uprising. Of course there were conflicting stories. Some people said that the uprising ended on the next day while other people told that Jews captured Pawiak (German prison in Warsaw) and Poles joined them and there was a general uprising at the moment.\n\nWhen I was on my way home I was even hoping to find Sara at home. My whole family worried about the fate of the uprising. I worked in Zoliborz and lived in Mokotow  so I passed Plac Krasinskich (Krasinskis' Square) every day and that famous merry-go-round (a merry-go-round, with a very loud music, placed by Germans next to the ghetto in order to drown down the sounds of fighting in the ghetto and distract the attention of Poles) I saw twice every day.\n\nOnce I also witnessed how a workman got out of an open entrance to the sewage system and he said to a group of people surrounding the entrance that he had set a trap for Jews: a bunch of hand grenades was put inside and when Jews would be passing the grenades would explode. I remember the same feeling as I had already experienced  when I had witnessed how Germans had tortured an old Jew and cut his beard, the feeling of being powerless and helpless. Fifteen months later I myself was passing the same entrance during the Warsaw Uprising. "

I worked in Zoliborz and one day when I returned home my mother told me that Sara had come. She must have attracted a lot of attention  because she had walked in sewage canals for 18 hours, than spent ten days in a forest without washing herself, covered with lice and having nothing to eat. She was very exhausted so she took a shower and went to bed. It was May 10, 1943. She came with the first group of 40 people who stayed for the night in Ogrodowa street. Later Kazik helped them to get to Lomianki (Warsaw suburb). PPR (Polska Partia Robotnicza Polish Workers' Party) had failed to help. Then a lorry was to take them further but it did not arrive and they sat there, with guns and no food and water. They were afraid to go to the wells in this village because dogs barked. Those who did not look semitic went to buy some bread but they could not buy much without attracting attention to themselves. Finally, a farmer discovered them and he took care of them bringing food and water; however, he could not bring much either without attracting too much attention. "

She had to walk without her shoes because it was impossible to put them on after walking the canals. When she woke up and said she had to go back but I told her she was too weak so I would settle everything and for the next few days I took care of ZOB matters. Later different liaison officers came. I remember Kazik talking about his trip to the ghetto in order to find his comrades (he describes it in his book).\n\nSara stayed about two or two and a half months in our apartment. She sometimes left our apartment. She did not follow any rules of conspiration, both at home and outside. If she met anyone she knew, either belonging to our family or our friends, she would gushily greet them in the middle of the street, endangering them. We did not fear that our neighbors could inform the police, however there was one family who, if they knew she was staying with us, would demand from us to get rid of her.  They used to put a lot of pressure on us, for instance telling us not to feed Jewish children who sometimes came to our apartment. So, apart from the janitor and our friends nobody knew about her.\n\nLater Sara moved to an apartment in Rembertow [Warsaw suburb] which was rented by ZOB. I think she lived there with Luba and she was shot by a German policeman while she was there. I do not know how exactly it happened because I heard a few different stories. Anyway, one day when, luckily, I had taken my day off at work the doorbell at my door rang at around 8 o'clock-- I would normally have been on my way to work then-- and when I opened the door I saw Sara who looked terrible, her face was green. Barely whispering she told me that she had been shot \"a little\" by a German policeman. When I took her to the bathroom I saw that \"a little\" meant that she had one hole next to her navel and another hole in her back (holes the size of a finger). She survived because she had a navy blue dress. The blood was on her dress, from waist down but fortunately it looked like dirt. First she had been unconscious, later she had spent the night lying next to the pool and drinking water out of it (although you are not supposed to do it when you have been shot in stomach). In the morning she managed to get to the bus stop-- 4 kilometres (about 2.5 miles) she had done in four hours, and without documents and tickets she went by two streetcars, crossing the whole Warsaw, to our house. It was an unbelievable feat. "

We were not sure whether father had finished distributing illegal bulletins. He might have still had them on him.\n\nDoctor told us that immediate surgery was needed. When he was alone with my mother and me he told us that there was little chance that Sara might survive the surgery since 14 hours had passed since she was shot. It was the day that stands out in my memory as far as the war period is concerned. Even the days of Warsaw Uprising I remember less vividly. It is so because at this moment everything depended on me. During the war I could not change the place in which bombs fell, but in this particular case everything depended on my presence of mind and quick acting. I even discussed that with Kazik and I told him that there are two reasons for which I remember it more vividly than other events: I wrote about Sara a few years after the war-- that was the first version of my book; it was finally published in 1958-- while he described his recollections after 40 years and for him, anyway, Sara was only a small episode while for me it was a very important event.

She did not have her documents-- the documents she had carried were authentic documents of a deceased person and the German policeman had probably kept them.

On my way home I went to my friends and asked them to give as much money as they could explaining that there was a possibility that we would have to bribe German policemen-- my friends had a firm so they had money. They gave me the money and I quickly hopped into a streetcar.
