          "text": "My name is Helena Balicka-Kozlowska. My maiden name is Balicka. My family has been part of intelligentsia for four generations. My father, who died in 1959, was a civil engineer and my mother, who died in 1957, was a pediatrician. Four generations of our family were socialists and I think this was decisive as far as the character of our activity during the occupation was concerned. There was a very strong tradition of fighting for independence in our family and my great-grandfathers took part in the January Insurrection (1863) and my great-grandmother helped insurgents too. My parents were actively involved in PPS (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna; Polish Socialist Party) and the Revolution of 1905. Later my father belonged to the communist party, my mother was not a member but she was strongly leftist although perhaps she displayed a more critical attitude towards communism than my father did.\n\nI was the only child. I was born in 1920. I attended a very good state school and I graduated from it in 1938. I took part in defending Warsaw. I belonged to civic committees and we organized help for refugees and those whose houses had been burnt. For a few days I also recruited volunteers for Robotnicze Brygady Obrony Warszawy (Workers' Brigades for the Defense of Warsaw). During the following years of the occupation I organized clandestine educational meetings, I worked to earn some money, completed a clandestine two year college of architecture and later I started studying in a clandestine Department of Architecture of Warsaw Polytechnic. I took part in the Warsaw Uprising, first in the Old Town and later, for a month, in Srodmiescie (both Warsaw quarters). I left Warsaw on October 5 (1944) with the other civilians. Later I managed to get out of Pruszkow camp and I went to Skala near Krakow. During the fighting between Germans and Russians I lost an arm. We did not know whether the bomber was German or Russian, it was two hours after the Russian army entered the area. I stayed nearly four months at the hospital, other members of my family were severely wounded too.  We came back to Warsaw in May. My father had been in Oswiecim since 1943 and he returned only in August 1945 and then we resumed our life. "

          "text": "I was born in Warsaw. First we lived in Nowowiejska street near Zbawiciela Square and since 1935 we lived in  a small street close to Pulawska street in Mokotow (Warsaw quarter). The school I attended gave priority to children of civil servants. In my class there was one girl who was Jewish. She was a daughter of a university teacher, later she was in the ghetto. There were also two girls who were Protestant and there were a few from mixed families. We were all on friendly terms and it (difference in religion) did not matter. The Jewish girl in my class was not baptized but her family was totally assimilated. I did not have any contacts with Jews which were not assimilated at that time. My first contact with the Jews who were not assimilated occurred in summer 1938. It was Sara Biderman. We were taking the same exam in drawing in a room in the Department of Architecture. There were models made of plaster of paris and we were to draw them. We were given a few hours to do this and we were allowed to wander round the room. I noticed that the only person who kept staying behind the drawing board  was someone sitting opposite me. I was curious so I walked up to this drawing board I then I saw a girl who looked a little afraid. Her face had Semitic features. I noticed that  her drawing was not very good; she had problems with perspective and I suggested to her a few improvements but she was so confused that she was unable to judge whether I gave her good or bad advice-- she told me that many years later.\n\nHer name also started with letter B so during the math exam she was sitting behind me and I since I was better prepared I sent her a crib. Later we talked a little. I failed an exam in compositional drawing and she must have probably failed more subjects, in general I was better prepared than her. After we had failed our entrance exam I lost track of her. I wanted to take entrance exam to the Department of Architecture the following year, in 1939 so I decided to go to Miejska Szkola Sztuk Zdobniczych (City School of the Decorative Arts) to learn drawing for a year. In this school there was a group of Jews of my age. They rather kept to themselves, they lived in a Jewish quarter and mostly spoke Yiddish among themselves; however, I did not notice any antisemitic attitudes towards them. I described Sara to them and asked whether they knew her. They confirmed and so I got in touch with Sara right before the beginning of the WW II but we were not very close. So she was the first person coming from the part of the society which was totally strange to me at that time. A lot of Jews visited our house but they were completely assimilated. These were not people who hid their origins but they simply considered themselves to be Poles. They spoke very good Polish, they did not look very Semitic.  Sara was the first person I knew who spoke Yiddish at home and, as I later learned, came from Hasidic family. She spoke good Polish but with a strong accent. She attended a Jewish school and the level of learning was high there so her Polish grammar and vocabulary  were very good but since students did not speak Polish among themselves so she had a strong Yiddish accent.\n\nMy father lost his job several times between WWI and WWII  for political reasons because he supported Jews. First time was in 1919. He worked in Warsaw Polytechnic and he defended some Jewish students. I do not know more details because I discovered this only after his death, going through some of his papers. Later in 1933, and in 1937. The 1937 episode became well known. My father belonged to Stowarzyszenie Architektow Polskich (Polish Architects' Association) and numerus clausus (a limited number of Jews accepted in the Association) or numerus nullus (no Jews accepted) was to be introduced. My father and a few others strongly opposed this (Roman Piotrowski, a future minister was among them). "

          "text": "My father said that at that moment he was ashamed that he was a Pole. This sentence became famous and was quoted by Jewish and right wing Polish press [in 'Endencja' - National Democracy Party newspapers] (no one else wrote about it). As a result, my father lost his three jobs within a week: he had worked in Towarzystwo Osiedli Robotniczych (Workers' Housing Association), lectured in Szkola Kolejowa (Railway School) and lectured in the School of Architecture for Women, the one which I later graduated from. He was jobless but after a few days Ms. Jankowska, an architect, came to my father and on behalf of Feliks Wislicki, a very wealthy director of the rayon factory in Tomaszow, offered my father a very well paid job of an engineer supervising the development of the factory.  A year later my father was offered yet a better and more interesting job: supervising the building of a new cellulose factory on the Neman river and my father did it before WW II. So it turned out that as a result of this episode in 1937 my father got better jobs.\n\nWhen I got in touch with Sara before WW II she did not invite me to her house, maybe because of poor housing. She visited my house maybe two times. She lived in Pawia street. When WW II began we were not in touch-- I had lost her address-- and she did not contact me either. I thought that either she was killed or she went East and crossed Bug river because she, like other Jewish youths around her, had very strong communist tendencies. Only a few  days before closing the ghetto with a band on her arm did she appear in my house, as it is described in my book.\n\nThere were German repressions against Jews at that time. For instance I saw cutting beards by Germans. In 1940 in Zbawiciela Square an old Jew was surrounded by German soldiers, maybe officers I do not know, and a circle of onlookers. He stood still and Germans laughed.\n\nSince our family were leftists we were not surprised at what was happening during the first years of the war. We knew what fascism was like. Of course there was no total extermination before WW II but we expected that Poles and Jews would be harassed, we knew about the Crystal Night. Similarly, when the ghetto was formed and some Jews thought their life would improve when they would be separated from Poles we did not think so, we thought it would be a disaster for them. There were discussions and I think none of the friends of our family went to the ghetto.\n\nBefore the ghetto was formed we had not had any contacts with Germans and we were not persecuted. My father was arrested later when Sara, wounded, came to us.\n\nWhen Sara wearing an arm band came to see me in my house in Mokotow after half a year of lack of contact it was a surprise. I was very happy that she was alive. She told me about the poor conditions in which they lived. She said that she had put out fires in September (1939, during the defense of Warsaw). She stayed for an hour. A few days later the ghetto was closed. "

However, if they had not been assimilated and looked very Semitic, spoke with a very strong accent and showed their the Hasidic background they did not have much chance of survival outside the ghetto and, anyway, nobody could foresee their fate yet. Sara came to me to get some news about me and she went back to the ghetto-- it had not been closed yet.\n\nLater I went to the ghetto several times but I visited her only once because she lived in the far-off part of the ghetto.  I usually could stay in the ghetto only a few hours since twice I crossed the border of the ghetto passing by the guards in Chlodna street. I put on my school clothes so I looked much younger and I told the guards that I had to go to a school which was on the other side of the ghetto and that I was in a hurry but did not have money to take a streetcar. Twice the guards agreed to let me go through the ghetto. Of course I had to return at the time when schools ended. I went to the ghetto to visit my friends, for instance my friend from school, a University teacher's daughter. I also visited the Hirschfelds at the presbytery of the All Saints' Church, their daughter Marysia and were in the same class in elementary school and her mother prof. Hirschfeld  treated some of my illnesses . I mostly visited people who I knew very well-- I did not know Sara that well-- and those who lived close to Chlodna, i.e. in the Small Ghetto or in the nearest parts of the Big Ghetto.\n\nI do not remember my first visit in the ghetto, all my visits are mixed in my memory.  I only remember that there were two other ways to get there: through the courts in Leszno (street)-- and they even caught me on the Aryan side as a Jewess because I was going out from the ghetto side-- and through the College.

In order to reach the ghetto one had to enter this building and pass the guards in a group of students who went to the ghetto and who had their special passes. Professor Zweibaum gave me such a pass and so I once entered the ghetto this way.  So I remember how I got to the ghetto but the details of my visits are mixed up. I remember courtyards in which tarmac was removed and vegetables were planted and I was told that it was a very common practice in the ghetto. I describe it in my book (\" Mur mial dwie strony\", \"The Wall Had Two Sides\"). I remember also a great contrast between the Small Ghetto and the Big Ghetto. Also, you could see a lot from the windows of a streetcar crossing the ghetto. "

Left wing press often wrote about the ghetto and sometimes Biuletyn Informacyjny (Informational Bulletin) described it. A lot could be noticed from the streetcar crossing the ghetto. Besides, there were more and more children begging in the streets in Warsaw. Few of them reached Mokotow (Warsaw quarter) but there were lots of them in Srodmiescie [Warsaw quarter closer to the ghetto], half a kilometer (1/3 mile) from the ghetto border and they looked terrible, barely resembling humans.

The whole family would live in one room. The Hirschfelds lived at priest Godlewski's, one room for three people, other Jewish families lived at the priest's too. Generally, the conditions were more or less as they were on the other side-- our standard of living went down too.\n\nPriest Godlewski was not a Christian Jew. It was a very interesting character. I think he was nearly eighty during WW II.  He was the rector of All Saints' Church. While doing my doctoral research later I found out  that he had been against Warszawskie Towarzystwo Dobroczynnosci (Warsaw Charity Organization) because he thought it to be dominated by leftists and one of my friends, an assimilated Jew who used to stress the fact that he was Jewish, told me a following story about him. My friend was a very skillful dental apprentice, made very good dentures and worked for a very good dentist. For this reason, one day he was asked by his boss to make a denture for priest Godlewski but the priest, when he learnt about it, said that no Jew would ever put his fingers in his mouth. However, after a few years the same priest came to my friend, Bronek [Arlen?], and offered to take his daughter and to hide her in a cloister. \n"

There were crowds of poor people, we had to squeeze through. A lot of them tried to sell a box of matches or a lace. Small children would earn family's living in this way because some people would take pity on these small children and would buy things from them even though they did not need these things.\n\nIn one of the buildings I was passing I saw lots of hands sticking out of the latticed windows, and heard people crying in Polish and Yiddish for help.  My friend who accompanied me told me that Jews from Warsaw suburbs were kept there and they had been taken from their homes without letting them to pack anything. I was told there were several such buildings in the ghetto. People by there on the floors, rest rooms were clogged, twice a day those Jews were given some watery soup, there were diseases and they all were dying. Jewish  ghetto authorities kept them locked to protect other inhabitants of the ghetto. When I was in the ghetto I saw people who looked like cadavers and I saw a lot of cadavers too. People who were very thin and people who were swollen with hunger.
